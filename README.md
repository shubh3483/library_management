This is a Backend project for library management through which a user can check the availability of the book and the admin can add or delete the books in the system.

REST APIs are used to send and receive the requests.

This is a basic project which leads to the understanding of how APIs works and what is their real meaning. Spring OAuth functionality will be added into the project so that there is a functionality for security also.

This is a completely Java based project and POSTMAN was used to test the APIs. However ngrok was also used on temporary basis to test the APIs from the external URL.
